# DV1537_OOP_CPP
DV1537 Object-Oriented C++ Course




## General instructions

1. Use GIT version control to manage your code and submit assignments unless specified otherwise (see separate instructions on how to set up and use GIT Classroom)
2. Your program should use text files as the only input. No keyboard input is permitted. Path to the input file should be the first parameter to the program.
3. Format output exactly as specified/exemplified in the assignment descriptions
4. Follow good code writing practices:
	
	1. Do not use global variables
	2. Divide classes into .cpp and .h files
	3. All parameters that are constants should be declared as such
	4. All variable and class names should be in English, self-explanatory, and must use camelCase. 
	5. All code that is not used should be removed
	6. Use code comments when the reasoning behind the solution is not obvious
	7. Always check that that all allocated memory is released and avoid memory leaks

5. You should not use any external libraries other than `cmath`, `iostream`, `fstream`, and `strings`. If you wish to use another library please check with the lab assistants first. 
6. The program should be robust against wrong input data. If there is an error with input file the program should gracefully terminate with an non zero exit code.
7. Real numbers should be printed with the precision of 3 decimal digits.


## Assignment A

The aim of assignment A is to test your understanding on pointers and working with classes. The focus
is on memory management, class inheritance, encapsulation, and overloading. This assignment has 4 deliverables:

### A1: Pointers and memory management

#### Instructions:
- Write a program that reads numbers from a file into a buffer. The file contains a series of number separated by a space.
- The program outputs all numbers that are above the average, separated by a space.
- You must store the numbers in a dynamic array and extend the length of the array as needed.

#### Example

```
Input: 1 2 3 4 5		Output: 4 5
Input: 0 0 0 0 1		Output: 1
Input: 1 1			Output: <nothing is printed> 
```

### A2: Classes
Instructions:
- Implement an abstract class Shape with methods:
	- getType() returns a string denoting type of a shape (point, line, polygon ..)
	- area() returns area of the object, or -1 if the shape is concave, intersecting, or does not have an area
	- circumreference() returns circumreference of the object
	- position() returns center coordinates of the object
	- isConvex() returns true if shape is convex
	- distance(Shape s) returns distance to the center of another shape
- Extend the Object classe into Point, Line, Triangle, and Polygon. Overload the inherited methods. Constructors of these classes take vertices coordinates as an input.

- The program should load a shape from a file and output its surface area. The input file contains a series of real numbers indicating coordinates of vertices. Example:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6.43  // Denotes a triange with vertices at (1, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6.43) 
```
There should not be a limitation of how many points the program can load.

Example:
```
Input: 1 1 1 2 2 2  		Output: 0.5
Input: 1 3.4 3 3 13.13 3	Output: 2.026
Input: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 0	Output: 2.5
Input: 0 -10			Output: -1
```	



### A3: Operator overloading & object cloning
Instructions:
- Overload the assignment operator `=` that deep copies the object. 
- Overload the addition operator `+` that makes possible to add more points to a polygon. The added points extend the polygon. 
- Overload the `<<` operator to print a formatted list of shape vertices
- Update the previous assignment
- The program should load two shapes from a file, add them using `+` operator, and print area of the resulting shape. The input file contains two lines, one for each shape	
Example:
```
Input: 	1 1 2 2 2 3
	0 1.6 0 1	Output: 2.1
```	




### A4 (Conclusion): Class diagrams 

Instructions:
- Draw a class diagram illustrating the class structure of A1-A3. Follow UML class diagram notation. Introduce and describe the figure.
- Describe 3 benefits of OOP over procedural programming.
- Describe 3 disadvantages of OOP over procedural programming. 
- Motivate your answers with examples, use references from credible online sources.
- Total length of the report should not exceed 2 pages.
- For A4 to be passed, you must pass A1-A3 before.


## Assignment B (To be updated)

This assignment builds upon the previous assignment and introduces sorting algorithms, and recursion, in the context of 
object-oriented programming. This assignment has 3 deliverables:


B1: Polymorphism
	Instructions:
		- Implement a Figure class enabling grouping of shapes. The Figure class should have the following methods:
			- addShape(Shape s) adds a shape to the group
			- getBoundingBox() calculates the minimum axis-aligned bounding rectangle to fit all the figures. The method returns top left and bottom right corners of the box.
			
B2: Recursion
	Instructions:
		- Extend the Figure class with the following:
			- getClosest(Shape location, int s, int n) - orders the list of shapes by their distance from the location and returns n closest shapes starting from s.
			- In the class, you must implement a recursive sorting algorithm of your choice


B3: Class diagrams
	Instructions:
		- Extend the class diagram from A4 with the new classes/methods.
		- When to use and when not to use recursion
		- Compare 3 sorting algoritms by ( no O measure)
